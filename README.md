# Logistic optimization: Delivery drivers location optimisation with Causal Inference 

## Overview
This project aims to optimize the placement of Gokada drivers to increase the fraction of completed delivery orders using causal inference methodologies. The project involves data exploration, feature engineering, and causal analysis to identify the primary causes of unfulfilled requests and recommend optimal driver locations.

## Buisness objective
Client: Gokada, the largest last mile delivery service in Nigeria. Gokada Works is partnered with motorbike owners and drivers to deliver parcels across Lagos, Nigeria.
Business Need: Optimize the placement of drivers (referred to as pilots) to increase the fraction of completed delivery orders.

One key issue Gokada has faced as it expands its service is the sub-optimal placement of drivers and clients who want to use Gokada to send their parcel. This has led to a high number of unfulfilled delivery requests. 
Proposed Methodology: Use Causal Inference to understand the primary causes of unfulfilled requests and recommend optimal driver locations.
